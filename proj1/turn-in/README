CORRECTNESS TEST 

To run the correctness test with the provided file "MSS_Problems.txt", please use 
the following command in your terminal without quotes:

"python main.py"

If another file is to be tested, ensure that the arrays have spaces between integers 
and commas that precede them.

The original MSS_Problems.txt had two integers without a space and our test will not
work unless the space is added.
